## A Historical E&P Look at the Wasson Oil Field
This README includes instructions on how to recreate the upstream simulation and reproduce the calculations which are utilized in the Wasson Oil Field analysis.

### Repository Structure
The petroleum_sim repository contains several folders which house various aspects of this project:
1. analysis

#### analysis
The analysis folder contains the interactive python notebooks (.ipynb) used for analyzing various aspects within this E&P project. There are several key notebooks:
1. petroleum_sim_analysis.ipynb - Considered the final report for the project. The petroleum_sim_analysis notebook contains information on the Wasson Oil Field, kick-off instructions for the upstream simulation, and analysis on the various aspects of the E&P sector.

Within the analysis folder, sub-folders store information utilized by the analysis notebooks. The following are the key sub-folders:
1. images - Stores all images used within the analysis notebooks.
